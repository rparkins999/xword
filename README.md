# xword
dictionary / crossword utility
This is a little dictionary search app. The UI is in Java,
but the actual search is done in native code to make it faster.

It can find anagrams or words which match a pattern,
and incidentally it can tell if a word is in its dictionary.

I originally wrote it to help me solve crosswords,
but it can also be used to help set crosswords.

It has the British and American Scrabbleâ„¢ dictionaries,
so it can also be used to check if a word is allowed in that game.
