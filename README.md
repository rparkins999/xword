# xword
<b>dictionary / crossword utility</b>

This is version 1.1.

This is a little dictionary search app. The UI is in Java,
but the actual search is done in native code to make it faster.

It can find anagrams or words which match a pattern,
and incidentally it can tell if a word is in its dictionary.

I originally wrote it to help me solve crosswords,
but it can also be used to help set crosswords.

It has the British and American Scrabbleâ„¢ dictionaries,
so it can also be used to check if a word is allowed in that game.

No permissions required.

Requires ```cmake``` to build.

It should work on Android 7.0 API 24 or later.

Licensed under GPl v3 or later.
